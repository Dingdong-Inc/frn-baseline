# frn-baseline

## Overview
The Repo is a baseline for Dataset [FreshRetailNet-LT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-LT), which provides the complete pipeline used to train and evaluate.

You can discover the methodology and technical details behind FreshRetailNet-LT in [Technical Report](It will be posted later.).

## Running Experiments

### Environment Requirements
It is recommended to create a new environment using conda.
```bash
conda create --name py3.8_frn python=3.8
conda activate py3.8_frn
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```


### Latent Demand Recovery
> Latent Demand Recovery implements multiple baselines, including TimesNet, ImputeFormer, SAITS, iTransformer, GPVAE, CSDI, and DLinear. The code is referenced from [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/tree/main).

```bash
cd latent_demand_recovery/exp
# Conduct MNAR evaluation on different models with various artificial missing rates, such as model=TimesNet and missing_rate=0.3
python app.py --model TimesNet --missing_rate 0.3
# Perform demand recovery on raw data, reconstructing demand from censored sales
python app.py --model TimesNet
```


### Demand Forcasting
#### SSA
> The similar scenario average (SSA) is a common method (statistics-based) for demand forecasting.

To train and evaluate easily on censored/recovered sales, run:
```bash
cd demand_forecasting/SSA

# Perform demand forecasting on censored sales
python ssa_forecasting.py

# Perform demand forecasting on recovered demand, which requires running Latent Demand Recovery first.
# For example, python app.py --model TimesNet
python ssa_forecasting.py --demand
```

#### TFT
> Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics.
> - Paper link: [*Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363)
> - Reference Code link: https://github.com/sktime/pytorch-forecasting

To train and evaluate easily on censored/recovered sales, run:
```bash
cd demand_forecasting/TFT

# Perform demand forecasting on censored sales
python3 trainTFT.py    # train models
python3 predictTFT.py  # evaluate after finishing trainning

# Perform demand forecasting on recovered demand, which requires running Latent Demand Recovery first.
# For example, python app.py --model TimesNet
python3 trainTFT.py --demand     # train models
python3 predictTFT.py --demand   # evaluate after finishing trainning
```

#### DLinear
> DLinear is a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task.
> - Paper link: [*Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?*](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26317)
> - Reference Code link: https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear

To train and evaluate easily on censored/recovered sales, run:
```bash
cd demand_forecasting/DLinear

# Perform demand forecasting on censored sales
sh train_predict.sh

# Perform demand forecasting on recovered demand, which requires running Latent Demand Recovery first.
# For example, python app.py --model TimesNet
sh train_predict_on_recovered.sh
```
